                        <h4>Background</h4>
                        <p>Baneasa Shopping City is the premium shopping destination in Romania having a 1.4M monthly foot-traffic. In 2015, we built and launched CITY iLOVE, Baneasa's loyalty app for iOS and Android.</p>
                        <p>With over 25k active users in less than 1 year, CITY iLOVE won numerous prizes in the fields of digital, emerging technology and innovation in retail like "2016 ICSC Solal Marketing Awards: Silver Award for EMERGING TECHNOLOGY, Berlin, Germany".</p>
                        <h4>Introducing CITY iLOVE</h4>
                        <p>CITY iLOVE app is a digital assistant that enhance the shopping experience in Baneasa Shopping City, Romania's favorite shopping and entertainment destination.</p>
                        <p>The app features 5 sections:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Newsfeed:</b> An engaging feed focused on news, events, and promotions.</li>
                            <li><b>Brands:</b> The place for finding mall's brands and stores.</li>
                            <li><b>Profile:</b> User's info, benefits, purchase history, and Inbox.</li>
                            <li><b>Cinema:</b> The movies and shows running in the cinema.</li>
                            <li><b>Scan:</b> A dedicated section for scanning receipts and parking tickets.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The focus of this case study is in the Cinema section for iOS.</p>

                        <h4>Design and develop the Cinema section as native iOS experience.</h4>
                        <p>When we launched the app one year earlier, we decided to focus on building the loyalty features first. The Cinema section was postponed to be upgraded in the versions to come, for v1 we went with a WebView loading the responsive website.</p>
                        <p>We knew that customers love going to the movies and we had the exact number of how many tickets were sold on each channel. The app channel performed very poorly, so an upgrade to a native experience had to be done asap.</p>
                        <p>Our goal for the project was to replace the WebView loading the Cinema website with a native experience. More so, our ambitions were to improve the Discovery phase and Post-Booking offline experience.</p>

                        <h4>My role</h4>
                        <p>I led the UX/UI design &amp; UI development. This was a team effort between Kinecto Isobar and eAD Interactive. In addition, I worked alongside a Product Manager, Project Manager, iOS developer, Android developer, and 2 backend developers.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-center">Use cases, not screens.</h3>
                        <hr class="centered">
                        <p>I began with 3 stakeholders interviews to understand the business requirements and define key performance indicators (KPIs). A full market research wasn't needed to move forward.</p>
                        <p>Instead, I started the user research process by conducting 1 individual interview session, 1 online survey, and 1 full day spent in the Cinema lobby observing customers and taking notes.</p>
                        <p>The goal of this exercise was to gather data about customer's behaviour, goals, and pain points.</p>
                        <figure class="article__figure">
                            <img class="js-lazy-image" data-src="//res.cloudinary.com/diuy8b72h/image/upload/f_auto/cases/user-interview.png" alt="Baneasa Shopping City">
                            <figcaption>User interview</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>I started to develop user stories and use-cases with a clear focus on user goals and finding pain points. The findings were used to evaluate design decisions.</p>
                        <h4>User stories</h4>
                        <p>I believe that the current model of defining user stories is broken. Something like "As a user, I want to buy a ticket, so I can access the cinema" doesn’t tell me anything about how the person chooses the movie (knows the title from the start or needs help to discover what's playing), if the hour is a filtering criterion, whether they need 1 or more tickets, and so on.</p>
                        <p>To inform design, user stories have to tell a story about the person using the product. The person becomes central, not the product. The product exists only to create the tools for her to achieve her goals. Real life goals.</p>
                        <p>The following are the user stories used into my decision‐making process:</p>
                        <div class="insights">
                            <div class="insight">
                                <p><b>As a single mom, I want to take the kids out to the movies. My kids want to see Spider-Man tonight.</b></p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="insight">
                                <p><b>As a high school guy that just escaped the friend zone, I want to take my new GF to a date. It should be a Romantic Comedy sometime Saturday.</b></p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="insight">
                                <p><b>As a hard-working, always busy husband and father of three kids, I want to spend some quiet time with my wife. I scheduled 3 hours next Tuesday evening, the title doesn't matter much.</b></p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="insight">
                                <p><b>My friends and I as movie lovers, don't want to miss an Opening. I have a Membership Card and I value all the offers and discounts.</b></p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>From this exercise, it became clear that we could help customers derive more value from the product if we offered multiple ways to find a movie. <b>My focus moved from "thinking in steps and screens" to "thinking in goals and functionality",</b> basically to understand and map the product interactions from user's point of view. Furthermore, the findings helped me to create critearia for measuring design success.</p>
                        <h4>Product features</h4>
                        <p>The next step was to translate the user stories into use cases.</p>

                        <p>My process involved sketching and white‐boarding concepts and flows and then translating these directly into high fidelity design comps. Since I was working with many existing design patterns, it was relatively easy to move straight into high fidelity designs.</p>

                        <p>In the meantime, the development team started to build the API endpoints and backend integration.</p>
                        <p>Things to keep in mind: our product development approach is to build an MVP, measure it against the KPIs and improve with each new iteration. For measuring specific screens and components we do A/B testing. As a design limitation, the Cinema is just one section of a full-featured app, not the whole app.</p>
                        <p>Let's dive in into each Cinema section.</p>

                        <blockquote>I do prototyping and usability testing not to find what I've got right, but to learn where I've failed.</blockquote>
                        <p>I built a quick HTML/CSS prototype for usability testing. The outcome of analyzing results is deeply influenced by researcher's goal. If one's goal is only to confirm her assumptions then that's the outcome she'll look for.</p>
                        <p><b>But, if your goal is to help the customer achieve her goals, then you'll continue asking questions until your solution will offer the best user experience.</b></p>
                        <p>Earlier in the process, I've defined use cases but I've forgotten the most important question: How fast does the user achieve her goals?</p>
                        <p>So I decided to A/B test the Grid layout against a List layout using the same tasks and different testers.</p>

                        <p>I began by learning what types of content we'll have access to and what's driving the customer to make a positive decision about watching a movie. Then started diving into the website's historical data, surfacing user behavior on the movie page, pain points and barriers to conversion.</p>
                        <p>I've found that the most important piece of content for decision-making is the movie Trailer. The second most important argument is the Showtime.</p>
                        <p>Working on the Information Architecture (IA), I decided to emphasise the Trailer by allowing over 30% of the screen real estate.</p>
